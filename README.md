# Birthday-Bot
My own bot that wishes people a happy birthday.

# About this

Hello there, Birthday Bot is the bot that wishes people a happy birthday in Reddit and is often banned by mods of r/teenagers though, I have released this bot in GitHub in hopes of the mods going here and reading that this bot ***does not make any spam*** as claimed by them.

# About the code

This bot was written in Python 3.7 and it currently runs on Python 3.8 24/7 at my local server.

# Other notes

I hope the mods read this and give me a more detailed explanation on why you're banning this wholesome bot.

Thanks!
